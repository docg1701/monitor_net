NetMonitor is a modern, cross-platform network latency monitoring tool designed to be stable, permission-friendly, and easy to use. It provides real-time visualization and statistics for network performance monitoring.

This application is rewritten using Angular, Ionic, Capacitor, and Tauri to ensure native performance and stability on Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android.

## Features

*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Uses native Rust commands (Desktop) or efficient HTTP HEAD requests (Mobile) to measure latency.
*   **Visual Dashboard:** Interactive line chart visualizing latency history (last 50 points).
*   **Live Statistics:** Instant updates for Current Latency, Average, Minimum, Maximum, and Jitter.
*   **Dark Mode:** Designed with a sleek, dark-themed interface for comfortable long-term monitoring.
*   **Cross-Platform:**
    *   **Desktop:** Runs as a native application on Linux, Windows, and macOS (via Tauri).
    *   **Mobile:** Runs as a native Android application (via Capacitor).
*   **Status Indicator:** Clear Online/Offline visual status.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Angular v21+
*   **UI Framework:** Ionic Framework v8+
*   **Runtime (Desktop):** Tauri v2 (Rust backend)
