## Overview

This script provides a continuously updating text-based graph of network ping latency to a specified host. It also displays key statistics such as current, average, minimum, and maximum latency, total monitoring time, and a count of consecutive ping failures. Failures are clearly marked on the graph.

The tool is configurable via command-line arguments for the target host, ping interval, Y-axis maximum reference, and the number of Y-axis ticks, or alternatively, through a `monitor_config.ini` file. It leverages the native `ping` command of the underlying operating system.

## Features

* **Real-time Latency Graph:** Displays a scrolling graph of ping times directly in your terminal using `plotext`.
* **Cross-Platform:** Uses the native `ping` command of Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* **Configurable Parameters:**
    * Target host or IP address.
    * Interval between pings (in seconds).
    * Reference maximum for the Y-axis of the graph (in ms).
    * Approximate number of ticks on the Y-axis.
* **CSV Data Logging:** Optionally log all ping data (timestamp, host, resolved IP, latency in ms, success status) to a specified CSV file for later analysis. The CSV file includes the following columns: `Timestamp`, `MonitoredHost`, `ResolvedIP`, `LatencyMS`, `IsSuccess`.
* **Failure Indication:** Ping failures are visually distinguished on the graph with red 'X' markers at the base (0ms line), while the main data line shows 0ms for these points to maintain Y-axis scaling.
* **Key Statistics:** Shows current latency, average, minimum, and maximum of successful pings, standard deviation (consistency of ping times), jitter (variation in delay between consecutive pings), packet loss percentage, total monitoring duration, and current consecutive ping failures.
* **Environment Setup Script:** Includes a `run_monitor.sh` script (for Linux/macOS/bash environments) to automatically create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
* **User-Friendly Display:** Uses ANSI escape codes for a smoother, non-flickering display update and hides the cursor during operation (terminal feature handling is best on POSIX systems).

## Platform Compatibility

This tool is designed to run on:
*   **Linux:** Fully featured, including `termios` for terminal settings restoration on exit.
*   **macOS (Darwin):** Fully featured, including `termios`.
*   **Windows:** Functionally supported. The native Windows `ping` command is used.
    *   Terminal restoration via `termios` is skipped (as `termios` is POSIX-specific). Basic ANSI escape codes for cursor control are attempted and should work in modern Windows terminals (like Windows Terminal or PowerShell Core).
    *   Users may need to run the script directly using `python monitor_net.py` (see "How to Use on Windows").

## Requirements

*   Python 3.6 or newer.
*   The native `ping` utility for your OS must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
    *   Linux/macOS: Usually pre-installed or part of `iputils-ping` (Linux).
    *   Windows: `ping.exe` is a standard system utility.
*   Python dependencies (installed by `run_monitor.sh` or manually with `pip`):
    *   `plotext` (for creating graphs in the terminal)
    *   `pytest` (for running tests, development only)
    *   `pytest-mock` (for running tests, development only)

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download Files):**
    If you have Git installed, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galvani4987/monitor_net.git
    cd monitor_net
    ```
    Alternatively, download the files (`monitor_net.py`, `run_monitor.sh`, `requirements.txt`) into a directory on your system.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal (or command prompt) and change to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the files.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/monitor_net
    ```

3.  **Make the `run_monitor.sh` Script Executable (Linux/macOS):**
    This step is crucial for running the setup and application script on Linux and macOS.
    ```bash
    chmod +x run_monitor.sh
    ```

## How to Use

### For Linux, macOS, or Windows with Bash (e.g., Git Bash):

The `run_monitor.sh` script is the recommended way to start the latency monitor. It performs the following actions:
* Checks for Python 3.
* Creates a Python virtual environment named `.venv_monitor_net` within the project directory (if it doesn't already exist).
* Activates the virtual environment and installs (or updates) the Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
* Executes the main `monitor_net.py` script with any provided arguments.

**Running with Default Settings:**
To start monitoring with the default settings (pinging `1.1.1.1` every `1.0` seconds, graph Y-axis reference up to `200ms`, and `6` Y-axis ticks):
```bash
./run_monitor.sh
```

**Using Command-Line Arguments:**
You can customize the behavior by passing arguments to `run_monitor.sh`. These arguments are then forwarded to the `monitor_net.py` script.

**Syntax:**
```bash
./run_monitor.sh [host] [-i INTERVAL] [--ymax YMAX] [--yticks YTICKS]
```

### For Windows (without Bash, e.g., Command Prompt / PowerShell):

1.  **Ensure Python 3 is in your PATH.**
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```cmd
    python -m venv .venv_monitor_net
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    ```cmd
    .\.venv_monitor_net\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```cmd
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the script:**
    ```cmd
    python monitor_net.py [host] [-i INTERVAL] [--ymax YMAX] [--yticks YTICKS]
    ```

**Available Arguments (for `monitor_net.py`):**

* `host`: (Positional, Optional) The host or IP address you want to ping.
    * Default: `1.1.1.1` (as defined by `DEFAULT_HOST_ARG` in the script)
* `-i INTERVAL`, `--interval INTERVAL`: (Optional) The time in seconds between each ping. Accepts float values (e.g., 0.5).
    * Default: `1.0` second (as defined by `DEFAULT_PING_INTERVAL_SECONDS_ARG`)
* `--ymax YMAX`: (Optional) Sets the reference maximum value for the Y-axis of the graph, in milliseconds. The graph will display at least up to this value but will auto-expand if latency spikes exceed it.
    * Default: `200.0` ms (as defined by `DEFAULT_GRAPH_Y_MAX_ARG`)
* `--yticks YTICKS`: (Optional) Specifies the desired approximate number of discrete tick marks (and their labels) to display on the Y-axis.
    * Default: `6` (as defined by `DEFAULT_Y_TICKS_ARG`)
* `-o FILEPATH`, `--output-file FILEPATH`: (Optional) Path to a CSV file where latency data will be logged. Each ping attempt (success or failure) will be appended as a new row. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created, including a header row.

## Configuration File (`monitor_config.ini`)

Beyond command-line arguments, `monitor_net.py` can be configured using an INI file named `monitor_config.ini`. This file allows you to set your preferred defaults without needing to type them as command-line arguments every time.

**Location:**
The `monitor_config.ini` file must be placed in the same directory as the `monitor_net.py` script.

**Precedence of Settings:**
The script determines the final settings using the following order of precedence:
1.  **Command-line arguments:** If a setting is provided as a command-line argument, it will always be used, overriding any other source. (Highest precedence)
2.  **Values from `monitor_config.ini`:** If a setting is not provided via a command-line argument, the script will look for it in the configuration file.
3.  **Built-in script defaults:** If a setting is not found in either the command-line arguments or the configuration file, the script's hardcoded default value will be used. (Lowest precedence)

**File Structure and Example:**
The configuration file must contain a section named `[MonitorSettings]`. Supported keys under this section are:

```ini
[MonitorSettings]
host = your.default.host.com
interval = 2.0
ymax = 100.0
yticks = 4
output_file = /path/to/your/latency_log.csv
```

**Supported Keys and Types:**
*   `host`: The default host or IP address to ping. (Type: string)
*   `interval`: The default interval between pings in seconds. (Type: float)
*   `ymax`: The default reference maximum Y-axis value for the graph in milliseconds. (Type: float)
*   `yticks`: The default approximate number of Y-axis ticks. (Type: int)
*   `output_file`: Path to the CSV file for logging data. If the path is relative, it's relative to where the script is run. (Type: string)

If the `monitor_config.ini` file contains invalid values (e.g., non-numeric for `interval`), that specific setting will be ignored with a warning message, and the script will fall back to the built-in script default (unless a command-line argument for that setting is provided).

**Examples (cross-platform, adjust execution for Windows as shown above):**

* Monitor the host `1.1.1.1` with a ping interval of 1.5 seconds:
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS/Bash:
    ./run_monitor.sh 1.1.1.1 --interval 1.5
    # Windows (cmd/powershell, venv active):
    # python monitor_net.py 1.1.1.1 --interval 1.5
    ```

* Monitor the default host with a Y-axis reference up to 100ms and 5 Y-axis ticks:
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS/Bash:
    ./run_monitor.sh --ymax 100 --yticks 5
    # Windows (cmd/powershell, venv active):
    # python monitor_net.py --ymax 100 --yticks 5
    ```

* Monitor `example.com`, logging results to `ping_log.csv` in the current directory:
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS/Bash:
    ./run_monitor.sh example.com --output-file ./ping_log.csv
    # Windows (cmd/powershell, venv active):
    # python monitor_net.py example.com --output-file .\ping_log.csv
    ```

**Stopping the Monitor:**
To stop the script, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it is running.
