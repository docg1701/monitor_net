# Quick Reference - Key Files and Entry Points

## Critical Files for Understanding the System

-   **Main Entry**: `monitor_net.py` (executed via `netmonitor` script defined in `pyproject.toml`)
-   **Configuration**: `monitor_config.ini` (INI format for runtime settings)
-   **Dependencies**: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`
-   **Development Tasks**: `Makefile` (for virtual environment, testing)
-   **Tests**: `tests/test_monitor_net.py`

## Enhancement Impact Areas

The planned enhancement (NetMonitor Enterprise Modernization) involves a complete rewrite. All files and functionalities of this legacy Python project will be deprecated and replaced by the new Angular/Ionic application. There are no direct modification areas; the Python codebase serves purely as a functional reference for the new implementation.
