# Next Steps

## 8.1 UX Expert Prompt
`@ux-expert` Please review the UI Design Goals in `docs/prd.md` and the `docs/architecture.md`. Create a specific UI specification or wireframe description for the "Home Screen" if needed, focusing on the layout of the Chart and Statistics Grid within the Ionic framework constraints.

## 8.2 Architect Prompt
`@architect` Please review the updated `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`. Ensure the "Monolith" Angular architecture and "MonitorService" design are clearly defined in the sharded architecture documents. Confirm the directory structure matches the standard Angular CLI approach as requested.
