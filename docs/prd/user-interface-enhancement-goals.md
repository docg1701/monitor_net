# User Interface Enhancement Goals
## Integration with Existing UI
- The new Light Theme must use the same layout and components as the existing Dark Theme.
- The Theme Toggle button should be placed unobtrusively.

## UI Consistency Requirements
- Color palettes for Light Mode must ensure sufficient contrast ratio (WCAG AA).
- **Chart Readability**: Chart.js components must adapt their colors (grid lines, tooltips, data points) to ensure readability in both Light and Dark modes.
