# NFR Assessment: Story 2.1 CSS Variable Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-12-06
**Assessor:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Non-Functional Requirements Status

| Category | Status | Findings |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Maintainability** | **PASS** | Significant improvement. Hardcoded hex values replaced with semantic variables. |
| **Performance** | **PASS** | CSS variables have negligible performance impact. Chart update logic is efficient. |
| **Reliability** | **PASS** | No impact on core stability. |
| **Security** | **PASS** | No security implications. |
| **Usability** | **PASS** | Enables Dark Mode toggle (future story), improving accessibility. |

## Detailed Notes

### Maintainability
- **Pros**: Centralized color management in `variables.scss`. Easier to brand/theme the application.
- **Cons**: None.

### Usability
- The refactoring prepares the app for "Theme Toggle" (Story 2.2), which directly supports user preference for light/dark modes, enhancing accessibility for users sensitive to bright light.
