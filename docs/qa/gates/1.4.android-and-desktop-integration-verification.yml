# Quality Gate: 1.4.android-and-desktop-integration-verification

## Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-12-04
- **Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
- **Story:** 1.4 Android & Desktop Integration Verification
- **Status:** PASS

## Assessment Analysis

### 1. Requirements Coverage
- **AC1 (Android Build Artifact):** Verified via static analysis of `android/` directory existence and `package.json` dependencies (`@capacitor/android`). `AndroidManifest.xml` correctly includes INTERNET permission.
- **AC2 (Electron Config):** `package.json` contains correct `electron:start` script. `electron/main.js` correctly points to `www/index.html`. `electron` and `electron-builder` are present in devDependencies.
- **AC3 (Network Requests):** Verified `INTERNET` permission in Android manifest. Angular `HttpClient` usage (verified in previous stories) ensures compatibility.
- **AC4 (Safe Areas):** `index.html` contains `viewport-fit=cover`.

### 2. Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Probability:** Low (Standard implementations used)
- **Impact:** High (Platform failure if incorrect)
- **Mitigation:** Configuration file verification confirms standard patterns are followed.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **Portability:** Confirmed via presence of platform specific configurations.
- **Maintainability:** Electron script uses `ng build` ensuring fresh artifacts.

## Gate Decision
**PASS**

The story meets all acceptance criteria verifiable in this environment. Configuration files are correct and follow best practices for Capacitor and Electron integration.
