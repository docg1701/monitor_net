# Story 1.1: Environment Preparation & Tauri Initialization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to prepare the development environment for Tauri and initialize its project structure,
**so that** I can begin integrating the Angular frontend into the new desktop framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Rust toolchain and Tauri CLI are installed.
2. `npx tauri init` is successfully run, creating the `src-tauri` directory.
3. The `src-tauri` directory contains a minimal, compilable Tauri project.
4. Essential Tauri v2 plugins (if any) are identified and added to `Cargo.toml`.
#### Integration Verification
IV1: The existing `ng serve` command still functions correctly.
IV2: A simple `cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (or appropriate host target) within `src-tauri` completes without errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Install Rust toolchain if not already present. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify `rustc --version` and `cargo --version` show installed versions.
- [ ] Install Tauri CLI globally. (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Verify `npx tauri --version` shows installed version.
- [ ] Initialize Tauri project in the `netmonitor/` directory. (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Navigate to `netmonitor/`.
  - [ ] Run `npx tauri init`.
  - [ ] Confirm `netmonitor/src-tauri/` directory is created.
  - [ ] Confirm `netmonitor/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `netmonitor/src-tauri/src/main.rs`, and `netmonitor/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` exist. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)
- [ ] Ensure `src-tauri` contains a minimal, compilable Tauri project. (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Execute `cd src-tauri && cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (or appropriate host target) to confirm successful build. (AC: IV2)
- [ ] Identify essential Tauri v2 plugins (if any) and add to `Cargo.toml`. (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Research necessary Tauri v2 plugins for basic functionality (e.g., shell, window management if needed for initial setup).
  - [ ] Add identified plugins to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` dependencies. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)
- [ ] Verify existing `ng serve` command still functions correctly after Tauri initialization. (AC: IV1)
  - [ ] Run `ng serve` and access the Angular application in a browser.

**Previous Story Insights**: No previous story.

**Data Models**: No specific data models for this story. (Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs)

**API Specifications**: No specific API specifications for this story. (Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs)

**Component Specifications**: No specific component specifications for this story. (Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs)

**File Locations**:
- New `src-tauri/` directory will be created inside the `netmonitor/` directory. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`, `architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md`)
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: Rust project configuration. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs`: Tauri's Rust backend entry point. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`: Tauri's application configuration. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)
- `src-tauri/capabilities/`: Security configuration for Tauri v2 permissions. (Source: `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)

**Testing Requirements**:
- `cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (or appropriate host target) within `src-tauri` must complete without errors. (Source: `docs/prd/epic-and-story-structure.md#story-1-environment-preparation-tauri-initialization`)

**Technical Constraints**:
- Migration from Electron to Tauri, leveraging native webviews and a Rust backend. (Source: `architecture/high-level-architecture.md`)
- Focus on Tauri v2 plugin architecture. (Source: `architecture/introduction.md`, `architecture/enhancement-prd-provided-impact-analysis.md`)
- Angular frontend (`netmonitor/src/`) remains largely unchanged, its build output (`www` or `dist` folder) will be consumed by Tauri. (Source: `architecture/quick-reference-key-files-and-entry-points.md`, `architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md`)

**Project Structure Notes**:
- The creation of `src-tauri/` in the project root aligns with the new architecture.
- The removal of the `electron/` directory is not part of this story but is a subsequent step in the migration process.

## Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: The new `src-tauri` directory should be created within the `netmonitor/` directory.
- Test standards: Ensure `ng serve` continues to function, and `cargo build` within `src-tauri` completes successfully.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Standard Angular testing for `ng serve` and Rust/Tauri build validation.
- Any specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Verify existing `ng serve` command still functions correctly after Tauri initialization.
  - Execute `cd netmonitor/src-tauri && cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (or appropriate host target) to confirm successful build.
  - Integration verification of `ng serve` and `cargo build` as per Acceptance Criteria.
