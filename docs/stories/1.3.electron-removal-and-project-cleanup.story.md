# Story 1.3: Electron Removal & Project Cleanup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to remove all Electron-related dependencies and files from the project,
**so that** the project is clean, lean, and solely uses Tauri for desktop builds.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `electron` and `electron-builder` packages are uninstalled from `package.json`.
2. The `electron/` directory is deleted.
3. `package.json` scripts related to Electron (e.g., `electron:start`) are removed.
4. The `main` field in `package.json` referencing `electron/main.js` is removed or updated.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Remove Electron Dependencies (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Identify all electron-related dependencies in `package.json` (devDependencies and dependencies).
    - [ ] Run `npm uninstall electron electron-builder` (and any others found like `electron-packager` etc).
- [ ] Remove Electron Files (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Delete the `netmonitor/electron/` directory and all its contents.
- [ ] Clean up `package.json` Configuration (AC: 3, 4)
    - [ ] Remove `scripts` related to Electron (e.g., `electron:start`, `electron:build`).
    - [ ] Remove the `main` field if it points to `electron/main.js`.
    - [ ] Remove the `build` object (configuration for electron-builder) if present.
- [ ] Verification
    - [ ] Verify `npm run tauri:dev` still launches the application correctly.
    - [ ] Verify `npm start` (Angular) still works for browser-based dev (if applicable/maintained).
    - [ ] Verify `git status` shows clean removal.

## Dev Notes
**Context:**
This story completes the migration Epic 1. Previous stories (1.1, 1.2, 1.2.5) have established Tauri as the working desktop framework and migrated network logic to Rust. Electron code is now obsolete.

**File Locations:**
- **Target Directory to Remove:** `netmonitor/electron/` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md]
- **Configuration File:** `netmonitor/package.json`

**Technical Details:**
- **Dependencies:** Look specifically for `electron`, `electron-builder`. Also check for `wait-on` or `concurrently` *if* they were only used for the Electron runner (though they are likely used for Tauri too, so be careful).
- **Configuration:** Electron projects often have a `"build": { ... }` section in `package.json` for `electron-builder` configuration. This entire block must be removed.
- **Entry Point:** The `main` field in `package.json` is the entry point for Electron. Tauri uses `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to find the frontend dist folder (`../www` or `../dist`), so the `main` field in the root `package.json` is likely irrelevant for Tauri and can be removed to avoid confusion.

**Testing:**
- **Regression Check:** The critical check is that the *Tauri* workflow (established in Story 1.2) remains functional.
- **Command:** Use `npm run tauri:dev` to test the dev loop.
- **Build Check:** `cargo tauri build` (inside `src-tauri` or via npm script if configured) should be run to ensure no build-time dependencies on Electron remain.
