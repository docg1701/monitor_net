# Story 3.1: GitHub Actions CI/CD Configuration (Desktop)

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** DevOps Engineer,
**I want** to configure a GitHub Action workflow that builds Tauri apps for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
**so that** I can automatically generate cross-platform artifacts when a new version is tagged.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `.github/workflows/release.yml` file is created.
2. The workflow triggers on `v*` tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
3. The workflow successfully builds:
   - Linux (`ubuntu-latest`): AppImage, Deb (generated by Tauri bundle)
   - Windows (`windows-latest`): Setup.exe or MSI
   - macOS (`macos-latest`): DMG or App
4. Artifacts are automatically uploaded to the GitHub Release created by the tag.
5. A `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` file (or section in README) is created documenting how to trigger and manage these releases.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create GitHub Action Workflow (AC: 1, 2, 3)
    - [ ] Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
    - [ ] Configure trigger on `push: tags: 'v*'`.
    - [ ] Define jobs for `release-linux`, `release-windows`, and `release-macos`.
    - [ ] Use `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0` (or recommended version) for the build step.
    - [ ] Ensure `actions/setup-node` and `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` are used.
- [ ] Configure Artifact Upload (AC: 4)
    - [ ] Ensure the `tauri-action` is configured to upload to the release (requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- [ ] Document Release Process (AC: 5)
    - [ ] Create `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`.
    - [ ] Document steps: Tagging, pushing, verifying actions, handling signing secrets (if applicable - note that for this story, we might use default test signatures or skip signing if not strictly required by OS dev mode, but typically macOS requires signing for distribution. For now, we'll focus on the *build* pipeline. Signing config is complex and might be a "stretch" or assume self-signing).
    - [ ] Add link to `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` in `README.md`.

## Dev Notes
**Context:**
This is the first story of Epic 3. We are moving from local builds (Story 1.4) to automated cloud builds.

**File Locations:**
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Documentation:** `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`

**Technical Details:**
- **Action:** Use the official `tauri-apps/tauri-action`.
- **Permissions:** The action needs `contents: write` to upload assets to the release.
- **Dependencies:** The Linux runner needs system dependencies (webkit2gtk, etc.). The `tauri-action` or a setup step often handles this, but explicitly listing them is safer.
- **Mac Signing:** Not strictly enforcing Apple Developer ID signing for this story unless the user has certificates. The goal is *generating* the artifact. If it's unsigned, it can still be opened via "Open Anyway" on Mac. We will aim for a successful *build* first.

**Project Structure Alignment:**
- Standard `.github/` directory usage.

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Integration Test:** We cannot easily "test" GitHub Actions locally without specific tools (like act). The primary test is to push a tag and watch the repo actions.
- **Mocking:** For this story, "Done" implies the file is committed and ready. The actual *execution* might happen on the next push. We should request the user to push a tag to verify.
